1.
1.Naive Add, Naive Mult, Sequential LC, Folding, Java HashCode and
Seq Java HashCode performed better.
2.I don't need the "industrial-strength" hash functions near the end of the list.
3.Naive Add was the simplest (i.e., earliest in the list) hash
function to do reasonably well.

2.
A. Mean lookup cost: 7.736111
Optimal lookup cost: 6.420162677764893
performed well

B.Mean lookup cost: 7.736111
Optimal lookup cost: 6.420162677764893
same as the previous one
Because 2 divides 12

C.performed better
because the prime number are not multiples of ach other.

3.
A.its performance is bad, because there are many muptiples
B.slightly better, because we use the prime number
C.much better
