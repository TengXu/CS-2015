Jessica Alba
Jessica Marie Alba (born April 28, 1981) is an American television and film actress and model. When she was 13 years old, she got her first acting job. It was in the movie Camp Nowhere. She became famous when acting in the television series Dark Angel (2000â€“02). Alba later acted in several movies, such as Honey (2003), Sin City (2005), and Good Luck Chuck (2007).
She has been listed in the "Hot 100" section of Maxim magazine every year from 2003 to 2007, and was voted "Sexiest Woman in the World" by FHM in 2007. In March 2007, a picture of her was used on the cover of Playboy. Playboy did not ask her if they could use the picture or tell her they were going to use it. This caused a lawsuit that was later dropped. Alba has won several awards for her acting. These awards include the "Choice Actress" award at the Teen Choice Award and a Saturn Award. Both of these awards were for her acting in the series Dark Angel.
