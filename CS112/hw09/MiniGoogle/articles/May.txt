May
May is the fifth month of the year, coming between April and June. It has 31 days. The month of May might have been named for the Roman goddess Maia, or more likely the Roman goddess of fertility Bona Dea, whose festival was held in May.
May's flower is the Lily of the Valley. Its birthstone is the emerald. The meaning of the emerald is success in love.
