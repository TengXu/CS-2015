Potential energy
Potential energy is a form of stored energy. For example, when a rock is brought up a hill and is left on the hill, the rock gains gravitational potential energy. When we stretch a rubber band, we say that the rubber band has gained elastic potential energy. Food that we eat has chemical potential energy. Batteries also have chemical potential energy.
Potential energy is divided into three different types of energy.
