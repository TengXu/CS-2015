Fish
Fish (plural: fish or fishes) are vertebrates which live in water and breathe using gills.
That is a simple way to define fish, but it is not quite accurate. Some amphibia are not fish, but live in water and have external gills. That is why biologists use a more complicated definition: fish are gill-bearing aquatic vertebrates which lack limbs with digits (fingers & toes).
'Fish' is a paraphyletic term because it lacks a monophyletic group of descendants. In other words, it lacks the land vertebrates or tetrapods, which descended from fish. Fish used to be a class of vertebrates which live in water. Now the term covers five classes of aquatic vertebrates:
Jawless fish
â€ Armoured fish
Cartilaginous fish
Ray-finned fish
Lobe-finned fish
Fish are usually covered with scales, and have two sets of paired fins, and several unpaired fins. They are usually cold-blooded. A fish takes in the oxygen from the water using gills. There are many different kinds of fish. They live in fresh water in lakes and rivers, and in salt water in the ocean. Some fish are less than one centimeter long. The largest fish is the whale shark, which can be almost 15 meters long and weigh 15 tons. Most fish live in the water. A group of fish called the Lungfish have developed lungs, because they live in rivers and pools that dry up, certain parts of the year.
Certain animals that have the word fish in their name are not really fish: Crayfish are crustaceans, and jellyfish are Cnidarians. Hagfish and Lampreys do not have a jawbone. Hagfish are craniata, Lampreys are Hyperoartia. Certain animals look like fish, but are not. Whales and dolphins are mammals, for example.
