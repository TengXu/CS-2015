Penguin
Penguins are sea-birds in the family Spheniscidae. They use their wings to 'fly' underwater, but they cannot fly in the air. They are sea birds which eat fish and other sea food.
Penguins live only in the Southern Hemisphere of the world: Antarctica, New Zealand, southern Australia, South Africa and South America.
