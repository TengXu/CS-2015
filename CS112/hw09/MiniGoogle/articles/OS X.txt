OS X
OS X, which used to be called Mac OS X, is the name of an operating system, for computers made by Apple Inc. These are called Macintosh computers, or Macs. It is different from other operating systems, because OS X is supposed to run only on Macs and not on other computers. However, people have made the OS run on computers that are not Macs. These are called Hackintosh.
The "X" in OS X, which is read aloud as "Oh Ess Ten", comes from roman numerals. OS X first came out in 2001, and is completely different than the Mac OS that it replaced. OS X is a UNIX OS that is based on NEXTSTEP, an older OS that Apple bought and turned into OS X. OS X and NEXTSTEP have a background in a kind of UNIX called BSD (more specifically FreeBSD and NetBSD). The core of OS X is an open source OS called Darwin, but Darwin cannot run OS X software.
OS X releases are named after kinds of big cats and have a version number that starts with 10. The newest version of OS X is called "Mavericks" and is version 10.9.x. The version before that is called "Mac OS X Mountain LionÂ¦Mountain Lion" and is version 10.8.x. There is one that will be released called "Mavericks", which is 10.9.x.
