Fermentation
Fermentation is when a cell uses sugar for energy without using oxygen at the same time.
Yeast is an organism that ferments. When yeast ferments sugar, the yeast eats sugar and produces alcohol. Other cells make vinegar or lactic acid when they ferment sugar. This is used to make beer, some types of fuel and to make bread rise.
