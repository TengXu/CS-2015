Lava plateau
A lava plateau is a flat, wide surface (plateau) that is formed when lava comes out of the ground and spreads out very quickly. The layers of lava can build up over time to form a lava plateau. Here are general properties of lava plateaus:
They are very large areas of basaltic lava with a layered structure.
Lava makes the plateau bigger, and higher, with each eruption.
They tend to be flat.
Ocean ridge eruptions make large plains on the sea floor.
The lava of these plateaus are thin and runny.
These plateaus take millions of years to form.
One example of a lava plateau is the Columbia Plateau in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho in the United States. Its area is 63,000 square miles (160,000 kmÂ²) and is 6,000 feet(1.8 km) thin. Another example of a lava plateau is the Antrim Plateau in County Antrim, Northern Ireland.
