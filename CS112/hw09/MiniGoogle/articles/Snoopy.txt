Snoopy
Snoopy is the name of Charlie Brown's pet beagle in the comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz. Born on the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, Snoopy started out in the background, but eventually turned into a main character. He had seven siblings, Belle, Molly, Andy, Olaf, Spike (His brother. He has met Mickey mouse and received a pair of shoes!), Rover and Marbles. All the siblings are shown at some point or another in either the strip or subsequent movies. The character Snoopy was noted for his many alter egos, including The World War I Flying Ace, The Scout Leader and World Literary Ace. Snoopy is a great cosplayer. Snoopy also became "Joe Cool" as he put on sunglasses and leaned against the wall doing nothing. He often had wise things to say about the humans around him. He has weak sight so he always wears a contact lens. He doesn't have dog teeth but human teeth. He often shares witty sayings with his sidekick Woodstock, a small yellow bird of unspecified species. He likes to eat cookies, and he doesn't like the cat next door.
