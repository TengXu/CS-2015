Table salt
Table salt, often called "cooking salt" or just "salt", is widely used in cooking to add flavor to food.
It is a compound of two chemical elements, sodium (symbol: Na) and chlorine (Cl). This is why it has the chemical name "sodium chloride" (symbol: NaCl).
In history, salt was very expensive. Salt was used to keep food from going bad. It was even used as money in some places.
Crystals of sodium chloride are almost perfect cubes.

Iodised salt can prevent goiter. A Goiter is a disease of the thyroid gland, which can happen in parts of the world where there is little iodine.
When salt ( sodium chloride) is mixed with water, the salt dissolves into the water creating the Saline Solution.
Salt can be made by either evaporation or can be mined. To get sea salt, man-made holes are built then filled with sea water. The water evaporates and leaves behind salt.
