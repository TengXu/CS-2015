Most of Azerbaijan's land is in Western Asia. It is called an Asian country by the United Nations.

On May 9, 2006 Azerbaijan was elected to membership in the newly made Human Rights Council by the United Nations General Assembly.

But, Shia Islam, is by far the largest religion in the country, followed by Sunni Islam. There are also a small amount of Christians (mainly Eastern Orthodox), Jews (mainly Ashkenazi), agnostics and atheists.
The name of Azerbaijan comes from Atropates. It was a Persian satrap under the Achaemenid Empire.
