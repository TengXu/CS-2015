Supernatural
The word supernatural is used for things that some people believe are real, but that are not part of nature. Because we cannot prove whether these things are real, people often disagree about these things.
Some say that we should talk about things without talking about the supernatural, because we cannot prove that supernatural things are real. Other people say that although we cannot prove supernatural things in a scientific way, they are real. Some examples of supernatural things are:
magic
miracles
souls, spirits or ghosts
angels
devils, asuras or demons
UFOs
legendary creatures
God or gods
parapsychology
