Periodic table (metals and non-metals)
Color coding for atomic numbers:
Elements numbered in blue are liquids at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP);
those in green are gases at STP;
those in black are solid at STP;
those in red are synthetic (all are solid at STP).
those in gray have not yet been discovered (they also have muted filled colors indicating the likely chemical series they would fall under).
