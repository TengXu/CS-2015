Hawaiian Punch
Hawaiian Punch is the name of a brand of sweetened fruit punch drinks owned by Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. (DPSU). It was created in 1934 by A.W. Leo, Tom Yates, and Ralph Harrison as an ice cream topping, and customers later discovered that it was an appealing drink when mixed with water.
In 1962, the character of Punchy was introduced in a commercial for Hawaiian Punch, eventually becoming the product's mascot. His long-time saying is "Hey, how about a nice Hawaiian Punch!"
It currently comes in the following flavors:
Fruit Juicy Red: the original flavor
Green Berry Rush: strawberry and kiwifruit
Mazin' Melon Mix: melon
Bodacious Berry: berry
Tropical Vibe: orange
Wild Purple Smash: grape and berry
The drink has its name because some of original recipe's main ingredients come from Hawaii.
