Farm
A farm is a piece of land used to grow plants and/or raise animals for food.
People who grow these plants or raise these animals are called farmers. This type of work is called farming.
Land that is used to grow plants for food, or could be used to grow plants for food is called arable land. A life raising animals for food is called a pastoral life.
Many farms in richer countries are very large and can cause damage to the world we live in.
There are many types of farming. Some people farm to eat the food they produce (subsistence farming). Opposite that, some companies have very large farms to sell the food they produce (industrial farming). Usually, subsistence farming is prevalent (more used) in poorer countries, while industrial farming is prevalent in richer countries.
