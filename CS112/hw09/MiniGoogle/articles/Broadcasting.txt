Broadcasting
In communications, such as radio and television, broadcasting means sending information such as television shows or music electronically to a large audience. The information is sent through the air in radio waves,through a wire, or by a Communications satellite, and then the television viewers or radio listeners pick up the signal using their television sets and radio receivers (modules). Gugliemo Marconi invented wireless telegraphy (based on air signal), in December 1901 he transmitted first radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean, however this was point to point rather than broadcasting.
