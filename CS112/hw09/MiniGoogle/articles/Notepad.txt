Notepad
Notepad is a word processing program, which allows changing of text in a computer file. Notepad was created by the Microsoft corporation. It is a very simple word processor. It has been a part of Microsoft Windows since 1985. The program has options such as changing the font, the font size, and the font style. The most common use for Notepad is to view or change (edit) text (.txt) files, though .dat and .ini files can be changed in Notpad as well. Many users find Notepad a simple program for creating webpages.
Unlike using special software programs to create webpages, a Notepad user must write their webpages directly in the HTML markup language.
