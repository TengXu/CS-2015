Hell
In many mythologies and religions, Hell is a place where souls of dead people go after their lives end. It is often thought of as the opposite of Heaven, and a place where no love and no God is. In many religions, Hell is the place where the souls of dead people go if they have done evil things in life. It is used in the Old Testament to translate the Hebrew Sheol, and in the New Testament the Greek ᾅδης, Hades, and γεέννα, Hebrew Gehenna.
