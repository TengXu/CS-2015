Newspaper
A newspaper is a publication printed on paper and issued regularly, usually once a day or once a week. It gives information and opinions about current events and news. One can buy a newspaper at a store or at a news stand. Also, newspapers can be delivered to one's home, if one subscribes to it.
Newspapers usually have a lot of topics in them. They usually include political events, crime, business, sports, and opinions. Many also include weather news. Newspapers use photographs to illustrate stories; and also often include comic strips and other entertainment, such as crosswords and horoscopes. They also often have opinion sections. The opinion sections print the opinions of people who work for the newspaper. These opinions, which are usually on stories in the news, are called editorials. Opinion sections usually also print short letters from people who read the newspaper. After being read, it can be recycled, or used for other purposes, like wrapping fish or lining birdcages. Usually people like to read them to stay informed about their local city or state.
