LOL
LOL is an internet slang term that means "laugh out loud" or, less commonly, "lots of love". It also means mute in Persian and is a native Dutch word (not an acronym) which means "fun" ("lolling" means "funny").
In Welsh, lol means nonsense - e.g., if a person wanted to say "utter nonsense" in Welsh, they would say "rwtsh lol". LOL is usually used on the internet or when text messaging.
