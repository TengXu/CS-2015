Point (geometry)
A point is a position in space. Imagine touching a piece of paper with a sharp pencil or pen, without making any sideways movement. We know where the point is, but it has no size to speak of.
In geometry a point has no size, but has a position. This means it has no volume, area or length. We usually represent a point by a small cross 'X' or by a small dot (a small, round shape). In geometry, points are always labelled by capital letters (A, B, C...X, Y, Z).
Mathematicians say two points can be:
coincident = they are one and the same
not coincident = they are not one and the same
and are always:
coplanar = on the same plane
colinear = on the same line
concyclic = on the same circle
Three points can be:
colinear
coincident
not coincident
not colinear
and are always:
coplanar
concyclic
Four points can be:
coplanar
colinear
coincident
not coincident
not colinear
not coplanar
Compare: line, plane
