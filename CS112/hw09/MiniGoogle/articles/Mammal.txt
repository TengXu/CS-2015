Mammal
Mammals are the group of vertebrate animals which form the class Mammalia. They have fur and a very precise kind of temperature regulation. The females bear live young, and produce milk for the young. Parental care of the young is universal among mammals, and it is essential because live birth limits the number of offspring.
