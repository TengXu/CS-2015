PlayStation
The PlayStation is a video game console made by Sony. At the time it was competing against the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn. PlayStation games were stored on CD-ROMs. The controllers that were first released with the console had no analog joysticks on them, but analog joysticks and a vibration feature were added to later controllers. A slimmer version of the console called the PSOne was released in 2000. Its colour was white instead of grey.
