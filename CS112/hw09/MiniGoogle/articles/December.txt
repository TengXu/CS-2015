December
December is the twelfth and last month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, with 31 days, coming between November (of the same year) and January (of the next year). With the name of the month coming from the Latin decem for "ten", it was the tenth month of the year before January and February were added to the Roman calendar.
December begins on the same day of the week as September, and ends on the same day as April, every year.
December's flower is the Narcissus. Its birthstone is the turquoise. The meaning of the turquoise is prosperity.[source?]
Some of the holidays celebrated in December are Christmas, New Year's Eve, Kwanzaa, and Hanukkah.
