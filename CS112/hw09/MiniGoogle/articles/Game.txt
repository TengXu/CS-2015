Game
A game is something that people do for fun. It is different from work. In many games, people play against other people.
There are different kinds of games. For example, in video games, people often use controllers to control what happens on a screen, such as a television screen. In board games, players often move pieces on a flat surface called a board. Some examples of board games include Monopoly, chess, and checkers. In card games, players use playing cards.
