Cold War
The Cold War was the tense relationship between the United States (and its allies) and the Soviet Union (USSR) (and its allies) between the end of World War II and the demise of the Soviet Union; i.e. the years 1945 to 1991. This war was unlike other wars in that the two sides never clashed directly in battle. The fear that the relationship would end in nuclear war did not materialise.
