Cannibalism
Cannibalism is where an person eats the flesh of another person. It is also called anthropophagy.
If it occurs in humans, scientists are unclear if it is widespread or not. There are certain diseases, like the sleeping disease, that are passed on by eating human nerve tissue, especially the brain. Sometimes, cannibalism was observed with people that have mental problems or some diseases of the mind.
An example of cannibalism by humans was the Donner Party in 1846 and 1847.
