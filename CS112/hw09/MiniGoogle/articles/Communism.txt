Communism
Communism is a social system which has no state, social classes, or notions of 'property.' It is also a political way of thinking and an idea of how to get to such a society. Communism is based on socialism, which means that when something involves more than one person, all of the people involved get to have some control of it. This usually means the state owns or controls it. Communism says that the people of any and every place in the world should all own the tools, factories, and farms that are used to make goods and food. This social process is known as common ownership. In a communist society, there is no private property. The main differences between socialism and communism are that, in a Communist society, the state and money do not exist. Work is not something a person must do to stay alive but is rather something people can choose whether or not to do.
