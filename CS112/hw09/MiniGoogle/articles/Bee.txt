Bee
Bees are flying insects of the Order Hymenoptera, which also includes ants, wasps and sawflies. There are about 20,000 species of bees. Bees collect pollen from flowers. Bees can be found on all continents except Antarctica.
Bees fall into four groups:
Honeybees, including the Africanized honeybee
Bumblebees
Stingless bees
Solitary bees
The European honey bee (called Apis mellifera by biologists), are kept by humans for honey. Keeping bees to make honey is called beekeeping, or apiculture.
