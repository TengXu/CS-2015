Erwin Rommel
Field Marshal Erwin Johannes Eugen Rommel (The "Desert Fox"), (15 November 1891 â€“ 14 October 1944) was an officer of the German Army in World War II.
He commanded the German Army in North Africa in a long struggle against the British 8th Army. He was finally defeated at El Alamein.
Later in the war he commanded the German forces defending the French coast against the Allied re-invasion of Europe in Normandy.
Rommel was well liked by the German public and respected by the Allies. He was thought to be chivalrous and humane, when other Nazi leaders were not. His famous Afrikakorps was not accused of any war crimes. Soldiers captured by his army were treated well and orders to kill captured Jewish soldiers and civilians were ignored.
Rommel knew of the plan by senior officers to assassinate Hitler in 1944. When it failed, all concerned were tortured and executed. Hitler offered him the choice of suicide or trial, and he committed suicide in 1944. His death was announced as the death of a hero in battle.
