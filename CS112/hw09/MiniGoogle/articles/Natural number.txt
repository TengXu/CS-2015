Natural number
Natural numbers, also called counting numbers, are the numbers used for counting things. They are whole numbers (called integers), and never less than zero (i.e. positive numbers). The special number zero is sometimes considered a natural number. Examples of natural numbers can be seen in the box on the right. Whole numbers are the natural numbers, but whole numbers always include zero.
The next possible natural number can be found by adding 1 to the current natural number, producing a set of numbers that could continue "for ever".
