Ice
For water in its liquid state see Water

Ice is the common name for frozen water. Other liquids, such as ammonia or methane or milk could be called ice when they freeze but the name would always be 'milk ice', for instance, instead of just 'ice'. Water becomes ice when it is very cold. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid ice at a temperature of 0° Celsius (32° Fahrenheit or 273 kelvin).
Ice is commonly used in home appliances such as the refrigerator or freezer. If water is put in a freezer and left for a while, the water gets very cold and will freeze solid, creating ice. Water can be placed into a copper (or metal) container to cause it freeze into ice faster. Metals are good conductors of heat, so water can freeze faster than in a plastic ice tray.
