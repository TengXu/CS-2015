Democracy
A democracy (a word from the Greek language, demokratia meaning rule by the people) is a kind of government. A democracy is a system where people are able to decide how their country or community should be run.
The most common type of democracy is representative democracy, where people elect their leaders (normally by holding an election) who decide the laws. Elections are usually held every few years. When they happen, whoever gets the most votes will end up with the most power, until the next election.
An important part of representative democracy is political parties. Politicians belong to a political party, an organisation of politicians with similar ideas on what to do. Therefore, in elections, people just do not vote for a single person but for political parties.
To become a stable democracy, a state usually undergoes a process of democratic consolidation.
