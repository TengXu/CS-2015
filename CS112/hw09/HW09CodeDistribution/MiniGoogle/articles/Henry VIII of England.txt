Henry VIII of England
Henry VIII (28 June 1491 â€“ 28 January 1547) was the King of England from 1509 until his death. He is perhaps one of England's most famous of monarchs, because he split from the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope and he married six times.
Henry was born in Greenwich Palace on 28 June 1491 and was the second son of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York. He had an elder brother, who was called Arthur, Prince of Wales, and two sisters, who were called Margaret and Mary. Arthur should have been king after their father died, but Arthur died before his father, making Henry next in line for the throne. Henry ended up marrying Arthur's widow, Catherine of Aragon. He is creditied as a talented composer and author. Fundamentally however King Henry VIII was famously unpredictable and temperamental with many of his subjects executed under his orders, including two of his own wives. His physical decline dominated his later reign and he became hugely obese. As he lay dying in 1547, Henry's last words are reported to have been "monks monks monks", with certain historians believing it as a reference to the monks he evicted during the dissolution of the monasteries. He died at the age of 55 in 1547, on the day which would have been his father's King Henry VII 90th Birthday.
