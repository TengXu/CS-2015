Eye
For the eye of a cyclone, see eye (cyclone).

The eye is an organ for sensing light so animals may see. About 97 percent of animals have eyes. Image-resolving eyes are present in cnidaria, molluscs, chordates, annelids and arthropods.
In mammals, two kinds of cells, rods and cones, allow sight by sending signals through the optic nerve to the brain.
Some animals can see light that humans can not see. They can see ultraviolet or infrared light.
The lens on the front part of the eye acts like a camera lens. It can be pulled flatter by muscles inside the eye, or allowed to become rounder. As some people get older, they may not be as able to do this perfectly. Many people are born with other small problems or get them later in life, and they may need eyeglasses (or contact lenses) to fix the problem.
