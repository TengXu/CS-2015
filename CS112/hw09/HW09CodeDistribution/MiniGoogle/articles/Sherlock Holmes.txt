Sherlock Holmes
Sherlock Holmes is a character from books written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. His most famous story was The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Many of the stories were made into movies and television dramas. He is a detective (He tries to find out who did a crime). He is famous for his detective skills and for solving mysteries. There is a monument in London dedicated to him. He has a sharp mind and solves even the most difficult and strange cases. He works with his friend Dr Watson, a retired army officer. Holmes plays the violin and smokes a pipe. Sometimes when he has not got any cases to solve, he uses drugs. He is very smart. He first appeared in 1887 and is known for his detective skills. People sometimes get surprised because he takes cocaine and morphine. He was the best detective in the world and it will always stay that way. It says Sherlock Holmes was born on 6th January 1861, and for more than 100 years his name has been known in every country of the world; and not only his name, but his appearance too. The hawk-like features and piercing eyes; the dressing-gown and pipe; the funny cap and magnifying glass - these details are so familiar that if he were to appear amongst us today we should know him at once.
He is still however a mysterious figure, as wrapped in mystery as the crimes he tried to solve, and as in most legends, it is often difficult to tell truth from lies.
