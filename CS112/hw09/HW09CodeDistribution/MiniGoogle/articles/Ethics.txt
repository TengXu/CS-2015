Ethics
Ethics is the part of philosophy that deals with good and evil. Ethics tries to answer questions like:
What actions are good? What actions are evil?
How can we tell the difference?
Are good and evil the same for everyone?
How should we make hard decisions that might help or hurt other people?
How do our actions affect others?
