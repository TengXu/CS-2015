License
A license (or licence) allows a person or company to do something that they otherwise are not allowed to do. A person usually has to pay some money, and maybe pass a test to get a license. A license is usually written but it does not have to be. Most kinds of licenses can only be used by the person they were given to. Licenses may be temporary or permanent. Some licenses can not be taken away once they are given. A person with a license is called a licensee.
For example, John has a license to sell vegetables in the market for 10 years from 2010 to 2020. John grants an exclusive license to Jane to sell vegetables for 4 years from 2012 to 2016. Here, John will be referred as licensor and Jane will be referred as licensee.
