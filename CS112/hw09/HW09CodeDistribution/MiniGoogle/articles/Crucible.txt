Crucible
In chemistry, a crucible is a kind of laboratory equipment that is usually a cup, made of porcelain or non-reactive metal, used to heat chemical compounds to very high temperatures using a bunsen burner. One of the earliest uses of platinum was as a material in crucibles. Metals such as nickel and zirconium are also used as crucible materials these days.
