Kurt Cobain
Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 - c. April 5, 1994) was an American musician. He was the lead singer and guitarist of the grunge band Nirvana, which also included bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl. He was born in the city of Aberdeen, Washington.
Cobain was very influential in creating what came to be known as grunge music. Grunge musicians pushed back against music they saw commercial and shallow. Grunge was a reaction against 1980s stadium rock and metal bands that were more concerned with appearance than sound. Nirvana's best known song is "Smells Like Teen Spirit", which was often referred to by the media as an anthem for Generation X and grunge itself.
Cobain was diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder. He started using drugs when he was a teenager. He often used cocaine and heroin. Later in his career, he was admitted to special drug treatment hospitals several times. The last time, he escaped to his home. Cobain committed suicide by shooting himself with a gun and taking an overdose of heroin in 1994. There are conspiracy theorists who believe that Courtney Love, his wife at the time of his death, murdered him. He is a member of the '27 club' of popular musicians who have died at the age of 27, often from drug abuse.
Cobain also had chronic bronchitis. He used drugs to self-treat his undiagnosed stomach condition.
Cobain met Love in 1990. Love began pursuing Cobain in 1991. He married her in 1992 in Hawaii after she found out that she was pregnant with his child, Frances Bean Cobain.
In 2002, some of Cobain's private journal entries were published in a book called Journals.
