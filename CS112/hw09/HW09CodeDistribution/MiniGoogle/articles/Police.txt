Police
The police are a group of people whose job it is to enforce laws, help with emergencies, solve crimes and protect the public. People who work for the police are called police officers. They work out of a police station. Police are trained in first aid and rescue, because police officers are often one of the first people to get to a place where people are sick or injured, such as a car accident, or a fire.
