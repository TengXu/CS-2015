Summary
A summary is a short version of something, for instance a movie or a book or an article. It tells you the main things in the movie or article or book in a short way and leaving out the details (the less important things). Many scientific journals publish a summary for every large article so people who do not have much time can read the main information quickly without spending too much time reading the article.
