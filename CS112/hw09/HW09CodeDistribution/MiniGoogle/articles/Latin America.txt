Latin America
Latin America is a region of the Americas. People do not completely agree which countries are in Latin America, but normally, it is the parts where Spanish and Portuguese are spoken (South America, Central America, and Mexico). Sometimes the Caribbean Islands are also inclued. Other people call all American countries where people speak Spanish, Portuguese, and French Latin America.
The words "Latin America" come from the use of languages that came from Latin. The Spanish, Portuguese, and French languages, spoken by many people in Latin America, are Romance languages. Romance languages are derived from Latin. Not all people in Latin America speak Romance languages, some Latin American people speak Native American languages.
Most Latin Americans are Roman Catholic.
