Orphanage
An orphanage is an institution that takes in and cares for orphans. It can also mean state of being an orphan. This is when a child is an orphan.
Historically it was very often the church or the state who cared for orphans.[source?] Children in orphanage may often suffer from child abuse or trauma to be left by parents.
