Aphrodite
Aphrodite (Greek Ἀφροδίτη 'risen from sea-foam') is the goddess of love and beauty in Greek mythology, and one of the Twelve Olympians. Many artists chose to portray her as a naked woman, or with very little clothing.
The major theory of Aphrodite's birth was that she was the daughter of Zeus and Dione. Another theory states that Aphrodite was born from sea-foam near Paphos, Cyprus. She appeared from the sea.
