Korea
Korea is in northeast Asia. It covers a peninsula called the Korean Peninsula. Korea became a country (or state) in 918. In 1948, it split into two countries: North Korea and South Korea. North and South Korea and their allies fought against each other in the Korean War.
People have lived in Korea for about 15,000 years. In the past, some of Manchuria and Siberia were governed by Korea.
The best silk came from Korea. In the 7th century, the people of China also liked gold-workers from Korea. Europeans knew very little about Korea until modern times. Koreans built a printing machine in 1232. This machine used metal letters. This was long before Johannes Gutenberg improved the printing press in Europe.
Korea is famous for its traditional food kimchi. Kimchi is spicy pickled Chinese cabbage. It is very popular in Korea.
The Korean people usually eat sticky white rice. Traditionally, Koreans eat seaweed soup on their birthdays. People believe the soup is also good for pregnant women.
South Korea has over 48 million people, and North Korea has more than 23 million. South Korea's biggest city is Seoul, the capital of South Korea. The city has more than 10 million people and the region of Seoul has more than 21 million people. North Korea's biggest city is Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. It has fewer than 4 million people.
Korean people speak Korean. Many people in South Korea study English and other languages in school.
South Korea is an advanced country with large cities, high-speed trains, high-speed internet, and many television and radio networks. Many Korean television dramas are popular around the world. Korean TV commercials are among the most expensive in the world[source?]. But there are still poor areas in Korea. The Korean farmers are not rich and struggle to compete with cheap food from other countries.
