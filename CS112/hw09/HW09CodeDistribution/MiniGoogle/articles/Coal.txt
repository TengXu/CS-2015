Coal
Coal is a black rock, and a solid fossil fuel.
It is usually very hard. Coal is made of 65â€“95% carbon. It also has hydrocarbons and some other compounds in it.
Coal is a metamorphic rock formed from peat by the pressure of rocks laid down later on top. The harder forms of coal, such as anthracite, have been changed by higher temperature as well as pressure.
Peat, and therefore coal, is formed from the remains of plants which lived millions of years ago in tropical wetlands, such as those of the late Carboniferous period (the Pennsylvanian). A similar substance made from wood by heating it in an airless space is called charcoal.
Coal can be burned for energy or heat. About two-thirds of the coal mined today is burned in power stations to make electricity. Coal is becoming less popular in new power plants as less expensive and less polluting technologies such as natural gas and hydroelectricity take over.
Coal can be dry-distilled (heated in high temperature in a place where there is no oxygen) to produce coke. Coke is even better fuel than coal, and coke can be used in smelting for reducing metals from ores.
