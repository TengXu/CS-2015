Disease
A disease or medical condition is a weird occurring of the body or mind that causes pain, discomfort, distress, or death to the person who has the disease. The term is sometimes used broadly to include injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts these may be considered separate categories. Literally, a disease refers to the invasion of the body by pathogens.
