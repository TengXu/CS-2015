Joseph Stalin
Joseph Stalin (or Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin; 18 December 1878  â€“ 5 March 1953) was the leader of the Soviet Union from 1922 until his death. He was a totalitarian ruler, and stayed in power by removing anyone he thought might be a threat to him. His ideas and policies turned the Soviet Union into a powerful, modern nation, the largest on Earth. It also led to the deaths of millions of people. His form of communism was later called Stalinism. Stalin invaded Poland on 18 September 1939. In the subsequent World War II, Stalin first allied with Germany's leader Adolf Hitler. He then fought a bloody war after Germany invaded the Soviet Union. The end of the war saw Stalin gain control of all Eastern Europe including a part of Germany. There, a series of loyal Communist governments were set up, extending his power and determining the Soviet Union's position as a superpower.
Stalin replaced Vladimir Lenin.
