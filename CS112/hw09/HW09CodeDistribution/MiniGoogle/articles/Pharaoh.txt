Pharaoh
Pharaohs were the rulers of ancient Egypt. Before the union of Upper and Lower Egypt, kings would wear crowns of different design, to show which part of Egypt they had rule over. The red crown was worn in Lower Egypt and the white crown in Upper Egypt. In later history, kings of the whole of ancient Egypt would wear a combination of the two crowns, called a Pschent. The word comes from the Egyptian word Per-aa, which means "Great House". Pharaohs were believed to be descended from the gods. When a Pharaoh died, all the treasure that they owned would be buried with them.
The Pharaohs are often closely linked to the Pyramids as they were burial tombs for the Pharaohs themselves. Another famous burial place for Pharaohs is the Valley of the Kings.
