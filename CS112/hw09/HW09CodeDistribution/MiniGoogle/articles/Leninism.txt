Leninism
Vladimir Lenin was a Russian Marxist. He had a set of political ideas based on Marxism. Lenin's development of Marxism has become known as Leninism.
These ideas include:
Democratic Centralism, also known as the idea of the vanguard party. Like other Communists, Lenin wanted to see a Socialist revolution led by the working class. But he thought the workers needed strong leadership in the form of a Revolutionary Party organised along Democratic Centralist lines. Lenin wanted Communist political parties in every country to lead the revolution. He thought the vanguard party would need have strong discipline, or it would fail.
The idea that capitalism is the cause of imperialism (empire-building). He thought that imperialism was the "highest point" of capitalism.
