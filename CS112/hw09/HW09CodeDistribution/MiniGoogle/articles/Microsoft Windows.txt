Microsoft Windows
Microsoft Windows is a popular operating system software for computers. Windows is made by the Microsoft company. Almost 90% of desktop and laptop computers have Windows installed (included). The newest version of Windows is Windows 8.1. Most newly bought personal computers have Windows 8 or Windows 7 installed. Some cheaper computers have older versions of Windows included.
In November 20, 1985 "Microsoft Windows version 1.0" went on sale. Windows 8.1 went on sale in August, 2013.
Windows makes it easier to run programs (applications) than DOS did. It also helps people keep their files safe and in order.
Some programs are included with Windows. Some examples:
Wordpad - to write simple documents
Photo viewer - to look at pictures
Paint - to make simple drawings
Internet Explorer Web browser - to use the Internet to look at web pages and download files.
Windows Media Player - to listen to music and watch videos.
Many new applications are available that are not included with Windows. Some popular applications are games, word processors (to write letters) or add-on programs like Adobe Flash Player (to watch video clips and play games on websites). Adding new applications to Windows is called "installing". Applications can be bought on a CD or DVD. Applications can also be downloaded from the Internet, sometimes for free.
