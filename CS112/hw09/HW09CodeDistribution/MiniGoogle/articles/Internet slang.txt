Internet slang
Internet slang is slang words which are used on the Internet. Most of these words are new, such as Wiki and blog, which were not used before the Internet became popular.
Some old words were given new meanings, such as mail (Which now means email), and these compare the old communication methods with the new ways using the Internet. There are many mixed metaphors on the Internet, such as boot (Which used to mean a shoe) and link (Which used to mean a join in a metal chain). Some existing acronyms, such as "AFK" (To mean "Away from keyboard") and "IRL" (To mean "In real life") were used on bulletin board systems before the Internet became popular. These are now used on the Internet, such as in chat rooms and on instant messenger software.
People have also created some verbs and adjectives to describe things that only happen on the Internet:
To flame - To send offensive messages, usually in chat rooms, forums, instant messaging software or email.
To ping - To send some data to another computer and see how long it takes for the data to come back.
