Human
A human is a member of the species Homo sapiens which means 'wise man' in Latin.
Biologists since Linnaeus put humans in the animal order of primates. Apes are also primates, and are the nearest animal relations to humans. Humans, like other primates, are social animals. They usually live in groups, helping and protecting each other, and caring for their offspring (children). Humans are bipedal, which means they walk on two legs. Humans have a complex brain, which lets them use language, make ideas, and feel emotions. This brain, and the fact that arms are not needed for walking, lets humans use tools, which they do more than any other species.
There are humans living on every continent. There are over 7 billion people living on planet Earth, as of 2012.
