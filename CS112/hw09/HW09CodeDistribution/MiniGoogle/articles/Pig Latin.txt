Pig Latin
Pig Latin is a language code or game and is most often used by children who speak English.
The usual rules are:
For words that begin with consonant sounds, move all the consonant sounds to the end of the word and add "ay."
For words that begin with vowel sounds, simply add "ay" to the end of the word.
Pig Latin that you write is sometimes written with dashes, between the first part and the "c-ay" letters, and sometimes it is not. A sentence can be "Is-thay is-ay an-ay example-ay of-ay Ig-pay Atin-lay ith-way ashes-day", or "Isthay isay anay exampleay ofay Igpay Atinlay ithoutway ashesday."
In Pig Latin, this sentence :
Is-thay is-ay an-way example-ay of-ay Ig-pay Atin-lay. As-ay ou-yay an-cay ee-say, its-ay illy-say, ut-bay ots-lay of-ay un-fay or-fay ildren-chay.
comes to mean:
This is an example of pig Latin. As you can see, it's silly, but lots of fun for children.
The British name for Pig Latin is "backslang".
