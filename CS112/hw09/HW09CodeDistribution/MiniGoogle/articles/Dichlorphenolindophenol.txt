Dichlorphenolindophenol
DCPIP (its full name is 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol) is a blue chemical used as a dye because when it is rusted, it is blue. Once DCPIP is reduced (by addition of electrons) it does not have a color anymore. This reaction can be reversed, and the colourless DCPIP will turn blue again, when it is oxidized.
