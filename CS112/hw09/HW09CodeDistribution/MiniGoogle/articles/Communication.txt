Communication
Communication is when information is passed from a sender to a recipient using a medium. There are different media that can be used:
Visual communication (using body language or gestures)
Communicating with sounds (like human language, but may also be the barking of a dog)
Communication using touch
Using smell
Using writing
Communication can be good spoken (a word) or non-spoken (a smile). Communication has many ways, and happens all the time. Not only humans communicate, most other animals do too. Some communication is done without thinking, such as by changing in posture.
Another form of communication tries to change somebody's mind. In an extreme case it can be propaganda.
