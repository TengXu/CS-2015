James Joyce
James Augustine Aloysius Joyce (Irish: Séamus Seoighe) (2 February 1882 - 13 January 1941) was an Irish writer and poet of the modernist movement. He was from Dublin, Ireland. He wore an eyepatch, because of eye damage. He could not see well.
His books are written in a special style. At first he wrote in a way which describes very accurately how life is, in the short story collection called Dubliners. In his next book, called A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, he started a new style. It is called stream of consciousness, and influenced many other writers in the 20th century.
Some books that Joyce wrote are:
Dubliners (1914)
A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916)
Ulysses (1922)
Finnegans Wake (1939).
Joyce met Nora Barnacle in 1904 and they began to have a long relationship until his death in 1941. The couple moved out of Dublin to Zürich in 1904, then to Trieste, Paris then back to Zürich. They married in 1931. They had a son and a daughter. Their daughter had a mental illness later in her life.
Joyce became a very famous writer after he published Ulysses. He also began to have a lot of problems with his eyes and his family. But he completed his last book, Finnegans Wake by 1939. He died in Zurich.
