Football
Football is the name for many sports. The most popular type of football is Association football, which is also named "soccer". Football can also mean American football (gridiron), ่นด้ซ(Ancient Chinese football), rugby union, rugby league, Australian Rules Football, Gaelic football or Canadian football.
The name football comes from the two words "foot" and "ball". It is named football because the ball is usually kicked with the foot. Although it is kicked using the foot, it can also be hit using the knee or head (in association football) and handling the ball is a part of many football variants.
The game started in Medieval times in the Italian city of Florence.[source?] It was played by peasants. Aristocrats, who were richer people, played sport while riding horses.
In football, the ball is almost always shaped like a sphere or an ellipsoide.
