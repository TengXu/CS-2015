Population
A population is the number of living things that live together in the same place. A city's population is the number of people living in that city. These people are called inhabitants or residents. The population includes all individuals that live in that certain area.
Population density is the average number of people in a place. In areas with a high population density, people live close to each other, such as in a big city. In areas with a low population density, people usually live far away from each other, such as in rural areas out in the countryside.
Usually population is about the number of animals or humans there are in a certain area. The maximum population that can be supported in an area is called the carrying capacity.
