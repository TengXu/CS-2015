Prussia
Prussia (German: Preu√üen, Polish: Prusy, Lithuanian: Prusai) was the name for a place in Northern Europe. It was part of Germany for a while, and included land in Poland, too. The name "Prussian" has had a lot of different meanings in the past and now:
The land of the Baltic Prussians (today parts of southern Lithuania, Kaliningrad, and north-eastern Poland);
The lands of the Teutonic Knights (a group of religious soldiers in the 12th century);
Part of the lands of the Polish Crown, Royal Prussia;
A fief of the Polish Crown, Ducal Prussia, later under control of the Hohenzollern family of Brandenburg;
All Hohenzollern land, inside or outside Germany;
An independent state, from the 17th century until 1871;
The largest part of the German Empire, the Weimar Republic, and Nazi Germany from 1871 to 1945.
In 1934 the Nazis stopped using the name Prussia for that area, and in 1947 the Allies abolished the state of Prussia, and divided its territory among the new States of Germany. Today the name is only for historical, geographical, or cultural use.
The name Prussia is from the Borussi or Prussi people who lived in the Baltic region. Their ancestors came from Lithuania. Ducal Prussia was a fief of the Kingdom of Poland until 1660, and Royal Prussia was part of Poland until 1772. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, most German-speaking Prussians started thinking they were part of the German nation. They thought the Prussian way of life was very important:
Perfect organization
Sacrifice (giving other people something you need)
Obeying the law
From the late 18th century, this bigger Prussia had a lot of power in North Germany; it was the strongest in politics and economics, and it had the most people. In 1871 Otto von Bismarck created the German Empire, and Prussia was the center of the empire.
