George VI of the United Kingdom
George VI (York Cottage, Sandringham House, 14 December 1895 – 6 February 1952), was born Albert Frederick Arthur George Windsor. He was the King of the United Kingdom from 11 December 1936 until he died. He became king when his elder brother, Edward VIII abdicated (resigned) in 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson. George VI was married to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon from 1923 until his death.
He was succeeded as monarch by his elder daughter Elizabeth II.
George VI had a speech problem, a stutter. This made it very difficult for him to carry out many of the public duties of a king which required him to make speeches. He was cured by an Australian speech and language therapist called Lionel Logue. The story of this part of George VI's life was made into a movie in 2010 called The King's Speech. Colin Firth played the role of George VI and Geoffrey Rush played the role of Logue.
He became a very popular king throughout the British Empire. He won admiration during the Second World War (1939–1945) in which he stayed at Buckingham Palace during the most intense months of the blitz. Buckingham Palace was bombed more than twice but he still remained, becoming a symbol of resistance and 'fighting spirit'. He opened the Festival of Britain in 1951 and enjoyed a close working relationship with the war Prime Minister Winston Churchill and invited him to join the royal family on VE Day to celebrate the end of the War.
A heavy smoker, His Majesty King George VI died of lung cancer and was given a large state funeral. He was fifty-six.
