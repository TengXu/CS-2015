Julia Roberts
Julia Fiona Roberts (born October 28, 1967) is an American actress and producer. She is best known for her roles in the movies Steel Magnolias (1989), Pretty Woman (1990), Runaway Bride (1998) and Erin Brockovich (2000). Roberts regularly plays characters of attractive powerful women. She has been among People Magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People in the world eight times.
It is commonly mistaken that Julia's birth name is "Julie". Roberts has said in interviews that "Julie" was a nickname given to her by classmates in elementary school, and she never took well to it. She reverted to her original name "Julia Roberts" when she discovered that a "Julie Roberts" was already registered with the Screen Actors Guild. Roberts originally wanted to be a veterinarian (an animal doctor), but later studied journalism. When her brother, Eric Roberts, achieved success in Hollywood, Julia decided to try acting. Her first breakthrough came when she played in two youth-oriented movies called Mystic Pizza and Satisfaction, both filmed in 1987. Roberts' sister Lisa Roberts Gillan and niece Emma Roberts are actresses.
