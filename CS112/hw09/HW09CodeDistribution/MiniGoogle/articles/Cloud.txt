Cloud
A cloud is water in the atmosphere (air) that we can see. It is where rain and snow comes from.
Water on the Earth evaporates (turns into an invisible gas) and rises up into the sky. Higher up where the air is colder, the water condenses: it changes from a gas to drops of water or crystals of ice. We see these drops of water as clouds. The drops fall back down to earth as rain, and then the water evaporates again. This is called the "water cycle".
The atmosphere always has a little bit of water vapor that humans can not see. Clouds form when the atmosphere can no longer hold all the invisible air vapor.[page needed] Any more water vapor condenses into very small water drops. That is what a cloud is.
Warm air holds more water vapor than cool air. So if warm air with lots of water inside cools, it can form a cloud. These are ways air can cool enough to form clouds:
when it is cooled by the ground at night, making a fog;
along weather fronts where warmer air is cooled as it runs into colder air;
when air goes up the side of a mountain and cools as it goes higher;
when warm air goes over something colder (such as cool water in a lake).
Clouds are heavy. The water in a cloud can have a mass of several million tons. Every cubic metre (m3) of the cloud has only about 5 grams of water in it. Cloud droplets are also about 1000 times heavier than evaporated water, so they are much heavier than air. They do not fall, but stay in the air, because there is warm air all round the heavier water droplets. When water changes from gas to droplets, this makes heat. Because the droplets are very small, they "stick" to the warm air.
Sometimes, clouds appear to be brilliant colors at sunrise or sunset. This has shown to be due to pollution in the air.
