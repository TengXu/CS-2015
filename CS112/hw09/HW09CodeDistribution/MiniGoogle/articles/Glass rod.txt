Glass rod
Glass rods are sometimes used as stirrers in laboratory environments.
Glass rods are often used to spread liquids evenly onto something. An example would be to coat glass surfaces with liquids to look at them under a microscope.
Glass rods rubbed with silk or fur were used in early demonstrations of electrical energy.
Glass rods are commonly manufactured in diameters of 3 mm, 6 mm, and 10 mm.
Glass is used for these rods because it does not react with most laboratory chemicals.
