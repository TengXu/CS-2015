New York
New York is one of the 50 states of the United States of America. It was one of the first thirteen states. It is well known for having the city of the same name, "New York City", in the southeastern part of the state.
New York is in the northeastern United States, bordered by Lake Ontario and Canada on the north, Lake Erie and Canada on the west, Pennsylvania on the west and south, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut on the east, and New Jersey on the south and west of New York City.
New York also has Long Island. Long Island is a large island in the Atlantic Ocean. Parts of New York City, Queens and Brooklyn, are on Long Island. The larger part of New York, north and northwest of New York City and Long Island, is called "Upstate New York". Some cities in Upstate include Buffalo, Binghamton, Rochester, Syracuse, and the state capital Albany.
New York City is the largest city in the state, but Albany is the capital. Between 1788 and 1797, the Legislature moved the state capital around between Albany, Kingston, Poughkeepsie, and New York City. Albany became the permanent capital from 1797.
New York was orginally New Netherland, started by the Dutch Empire in the early 17th century. Late in the century, it surrendered to a British fleet and became part of the British Empire. Several important battles of the American Revolution were fought in New York and it joined the new United States.
The United States Census Bureau says that, as of 2005, New York had the third most people (population) in the United States, after California and Texas. New York's estimated population is 19,297,729.
