Checkers
Checkers or draughts is the name of several different board games. All of these games are similar. In every kind of checkers, the other player's pieces can be taken by being "jumped" over.
"Checkers" is the American name. In British English, and in various other English-speaking nations, these games are called "draughts."
The rules and championships are controlled by the World Draughts Federation.
