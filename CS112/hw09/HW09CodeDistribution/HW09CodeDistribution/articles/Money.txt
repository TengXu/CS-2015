Money
Money is what people use to buy things and "services" (that is, to have things done for them) - and what they take for selling their own things or services (what they do for others). There are many kinds of money in the world. Most countries have their own kind of money, such as the United States dollar or the British pound.
Money is also called many other names, like currency or cash. Most of the time a state or a government prints paper money and makes coins at a special place called a mint.
