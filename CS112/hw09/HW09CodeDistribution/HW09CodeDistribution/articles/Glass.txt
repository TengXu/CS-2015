Glass
Glass is a hard material that can be made in many shapes. It is usually transparent, but it can also be made in colours. Glass is made of sand that is heated until it is liquid. When it is liquid, it is shaped and left to cool.
Glass is often used to make windows and bottles. Many churches have windows made of colored glass.
Glass is used to make lenses. The word "glasses" is often used to mean eyeglasses.
The myth that glass is actually a liquid comes from the fact that old windows in houses and churches (200â€“300 years old) are sometimes a little out of shape: thicker at the bottom than the top. This is actually due to the process of glass making in the past which led to the glass pane being thicker at one edge than the other. It was sensible to install the windows with the thick edge at the bottom. Sometimes a window can be found with the thick edge at the top of the window.
Glass can be recycled over and over. Glass bottles and jars can easily be recycled to make new glass bottles and jars or used in industry as aggregate (building material) or sand.
