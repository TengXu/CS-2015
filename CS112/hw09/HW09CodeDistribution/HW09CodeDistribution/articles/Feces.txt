Feces
Feces (or faeces), also called stool, is the body's solid waste left over from eating food. Human feces leave the intestinal tract and are removed from the body through the anus. Feces are known for their unpleasant odor and brown color.
Although feces are generally considered waste, they actually have many valid uses. Feces are used by some scientists to follow tiger populations. Feces from some animals can be used to create fertilizers for plant crops. Some feces are also used as a fuel for cookery.
In informal language, there are many words for feces. These are often offensive or even vulgar. Examples include "shit", "poop", and "crap".
