Messiah
Messiah or the Anointed One is the figure promised by God to the Jews for the salvation of the world. The Jews think that the Messiah will be a human being that will save Israel and lead the whole world into the End Of Days and eternal peace.
Other people in real life or fiction are called messianic if they have the qualities of a messiah, or people think they will bring about a better world.
