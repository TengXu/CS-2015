Eurozone
The Eurozone (also called Euro area or Euroland) is the set of countries in the European Union which have adopted the Euro (â‚¬) currency. The European Central Bank is responsible for managing the supply of money within the eurozone and political decisions are taken by the "euro group", which is a meeting of the politicians from each euro country in charge of that country's economy.
