Life
Life is easy to recognise, but hard to define. The study of life is called biology and people who study life are biologists. A lifespan is the average length of life in a species.
All known life on Earth is powered by solar energy. Without energy from the sun no life could exist. Life is based on the chemistry of carbon compounds. In particular, all life uses long-chain molecules such as proteins and nucleic acid. With water, which is essential, the long molecules are wrapped inside membranes to form cells. This may or may not be true of all possible forms of life in the Universe: it is true of all life on Earth today.
