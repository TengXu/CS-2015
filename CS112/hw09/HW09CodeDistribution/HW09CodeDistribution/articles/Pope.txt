Pope
This article is about Popes in general. For the current Pope, see Pope Francis.

The Pope is the head of Catholic Church. His official title is the Bishop of Rome. He is the Chief of State of Vatican City and the head of the College of Bishops. The current Pope is Pope Francis.
Popes are elected by under 80 Cardinals of the Catholic Church. Once they are elected they hold the position until they die or resign. Usually they do not resign, though; Pope Benedict XVI is the only Pope to resign in the last 500 years. After a Pope is elected, the pope chooses a different name. Everyone is told the new name when the Habemus Papam is read out. The current pope (Francis) was called Jorge Bergoglio before he became a pope.
The name Pope comes from the Greek word pappas, meaning "father". Catholics believe that when making statements ex cathedra, that is official statements teaching about faith and morals, the Pope is infallible - which means God will not allow his followers to be misled by allowing their leader to make a wrong statement. Only two of any Pope's statements have been ex cathedra.
Popes today travel to many countries around the world preaching. The Pope is the only person in the world who runs a country and a religion at the same time. The Pope wears a big hat called a mitre and holds a staff called a crosier.
