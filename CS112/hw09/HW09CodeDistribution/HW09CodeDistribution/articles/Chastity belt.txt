Chastity belt
A chastity belt is a device, locked around the wearer's genitals, intended to prevent sexual intercourse. Chastity belts for women were introduced into Europe via Italy around 1400, and saw some limited degree of use during the Renaissance period of European history. In modern times, belts for both men and women are used in BDSM.
