Indian Ocean
The Indian Ocean is the ocean surrounded by Asia to the north, Australia and the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Southern Ocean to the south, and Africa and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It is so named because the river Indus from the native word Sindhu means ocean, that empties out from the southern Asian country of Pakistan, because it is on its shore, which was Ancient India. The Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea are all parts of this ocean.
