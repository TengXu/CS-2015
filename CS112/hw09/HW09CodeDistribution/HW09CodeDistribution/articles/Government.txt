Government
A government is a group of people that has the power to rule in a territory, according to the law. This territory may be a country, a state or province within a country, or a region.
Governments make laws, rules, and regulations, collect taxes and print money.
Governments have systems of justice that list the acts or activities that are against the law and describe the punishments for breaking the law.
Governments have a police force to make sure people follow the laws.
Governments have diplomats who communicate with the governments of other countries by having meetings. Diplomats try to solve problems or disagreements between two countries, which can help countries to avoid war, make commercial agreements, and exchange cultural or social experiences and knowledge.
Governments have a military force such as an army that protects the country if other countries attack or which can be used to attack and invade other countries.
The leader of a government and his or her advisors are called the administration.
