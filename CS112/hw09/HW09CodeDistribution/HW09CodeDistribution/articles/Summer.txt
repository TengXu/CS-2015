Summer
Summer is one of four seasons. It is the hottest season of the year. In some places, summer is the wettest season (with the most rain), and in other places, it is a dry season. Four seasons are found in areas which are not too hot or too cold. Summer happens to the north and south sides of the Earth at opposite times of the year. In the north part of the world, summer takes place between the months of June and September and in the south part of the world, it takes place between December and March. This is because when the north part of the Earth points towards the Sun, the south part points away.
