Nim
Nim is a simple game used for examples in combinatorial game theory. The rules of nim are simple:
The game begins with some piles of counters.
Players alternate turns.
On a turn, a player takes counters from a pile. At least one counter must be taken. All counters must be in the same pile.
If a player cannot take a counter, that player loses.
There is a simple mathematical strategy to play the game perfectly. If both players play perfectly, the winner is determined by the initial setup.
