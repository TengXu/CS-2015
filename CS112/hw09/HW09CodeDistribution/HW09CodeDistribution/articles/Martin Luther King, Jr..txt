Martin Luther King, Jr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. (January 15, 1929 â€“ April 4, 1968) was an American pastor, activist, humanitarian, and leader in the African-American Civil Rights Movement. He fought for civil rights.
He was born in Atlanta, Georgia. He was the son of Martin Luther King, Sr. and Alberta Williams King. His father was also a civil rights leader. He was married to Coretta Scott King.
He became a Baptist minister. He worked hard to make people understand that black people should always be treated equally to white people. He gave speeches and led rallies to encourage African Americans to protest without the need for violence. One peaceful strategy was for African Americans to have sit-ins.
This is where they would sit in a restaurant seat that was supposed to be only for white people. They would politely ask for some food and refuse to leave until someone gave them food. Another strategy that King used was leading boycotts. This is where people would refuse to buy goods or services from people who did not treat white people and black people the same. King also helped to organize the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech.
King was active from the start of the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955 to 1956 until his murder by James Earl Ray in April 1968. King was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal posthumously. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established as a U.S. federal holiday in 1986. Hundreds of streets and a county in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor. A memorial statue on the National Mall was opened to the public in 2011.
