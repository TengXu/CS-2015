Sabbath in Christianity
Sabbath in Christianity is the day of rest and service to God. The idea of the Sabbath in Christianity comes directly from the idea of the Sabbath (or Shabbat) in Judaism. In fact, the word Sabbath itself comes from the Hebrew word Shabbat. Like the Jewish Sabbath (Shabbat), the Sabbath in Christianity comes from the Genesis story of Creation. But unlike Jews, most Christians have Sabbath on Sunday, not Saturday. They also rest, but not the same way as Jews. The exact way depends on the church denomination.
