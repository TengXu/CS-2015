Healing
Healing is a process that happens in the body. Through healing, cells are able to repair damaged tissue. There are two different ways healing can happen:
The damaged tissue is replaced with tissue of the same kind. This is called regeneration.
The damaged tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This is called repair
Most healing processes combine both ways of healing.
