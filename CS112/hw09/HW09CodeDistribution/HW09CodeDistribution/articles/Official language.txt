Official language
An official language is a language that has special status in a country or other organization. Usually the government does its business in the official language. They are sometimes named in a country's constitution. Some countries, like Canada, have more than one. Other countries may not have an official language. An official language doesn't have to be a written language. It can be a pidgin language (like in Papua New Guinea), or a sign language (like in New Zealand).
