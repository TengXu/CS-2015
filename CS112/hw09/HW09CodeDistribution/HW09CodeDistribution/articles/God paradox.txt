God paradox
The God paradox is an idea in philosophy. This idea is explained here:
If God is able to do anything, may this mean He is able to make a mountain more heavy than He is able to lift?
People say this question is a paradox because:
If God is able to make a mountain more heavy than He is able to lift, then there may be something He is not able to do: He is not able to lift that mountain.
If God is not able to make such a mountain, then there is something He is not able do: He is not able to make that mountain.
If either outcome were considered true, then it is argued that God Almighty is actually not Almighty.
