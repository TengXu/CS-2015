College
College is a kind of school or university, a place where people go to learn skills for future jobs. Most college students go to college right after high school but others choose to go later in life. Most students are there because it will help them to earn more money and live better lives.
In some countries, for example the United Kingdom, college also means a house belonging to a university, where students and teachers live together.
