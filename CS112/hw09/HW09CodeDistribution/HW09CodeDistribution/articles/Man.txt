Man
A man is a male adult human. He is the opposite of a woman. We use the word "man" (one man, two or more men) to talk about gender. Manhood is the period in a male's life after he changes from a boy. A boy is a male child, the opposite of a female child (a girl). After boys reach maturity, they can be called a man.
Like most other male mammals, a man inherits an X chromosome from his mother and a Y chromosome from his father.
