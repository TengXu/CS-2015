Natural resource
A natural resource is anything people can use which comes from nature. People do not make natural resources, but gather them from the earth. Examples of natural resources are air, water, copper, wood, oil, wind energy, hydro-electric energy, iron, and coal. Refined oil is not a natural resource because people make it.
