Memory
Memory is the personal record of past experiences. It is the brain's ability to store information to use later. It is studied in a special science called "cognitive psychology". There are three main types of memory:
1. Short-term memory, the ability to keep information in mind for a short time, like remembering a phone number long enough to find a piece of paper.
1.1 Sensory memory, in which sensations are first noticed, like smelling a flower.

2. Long-term memory, the ability to remember things long after they happen, like remembering a holiday you had last year.
