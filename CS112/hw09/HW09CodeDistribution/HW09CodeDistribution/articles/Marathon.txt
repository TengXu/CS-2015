Marathon
A marathon is a long distance running sport event where an athlete must run 42.195 kilometres (26 miles and 385 yards). There are many marathons held all over the world each year. It is a very difficult event and runners are advised to run many miles before they compete. This event was named after the famous Battle of Marathon.

In 490 B.C. there was an important battle in Greece. There was an army from Persia that came to fight the army from Athens. The battle was held at a place called Marathon. The army from Athens was not expected to win, but they did. After the victory, they sent their best runner, a man named Pheidippides back to Athens to tell everyone the good news, but he died of exhaustion. He ran about 25 miles back to town. In 1896 the first modern Olympics was held. There was a race called the Marathon there. It was only about 25 miles then.
