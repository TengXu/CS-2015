Mineral
Minerals are substances that are formed naturally in the Earth.
Minerals are usually solid, inorganic, have a crystal structure, and happen naturally by geological processes.
The study of minerals is called mineralogy.
A mineral can be made of single chemical element or more usually a compound. There are over 4,000 types of known minerals. Two common minerals are quartz and feldspar.
