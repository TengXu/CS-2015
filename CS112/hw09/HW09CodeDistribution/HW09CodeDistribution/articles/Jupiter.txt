Jupiter
Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System. It is the fifth planet from the Sun. Jupiter is classified as a gas giant, because it is so large, and is made up mostly of gas. The other gas giants are Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
Jupiter has a mass of 1.8986Ã—1027 kg, or about 318 Earths. This is twice the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System put together.
Jupiter can be seen with the naked eye without any special equipment. It was known to the ancient Romans, who named it after their god Jupiter (Latin: Iuppiter). Jupiter is the third brightest object in the night sky. Only the Earth's moon and Venus are brighter.
Jupiter has at least 67 moons. Of these, 55 are very small and less than five km wide. The four largest moons of Jupiter are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. They are called the Galilean moons, because they were discovered by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System.
