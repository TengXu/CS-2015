Mount Everest
Mount Everest is the largest and highest mountain in the world. Mount Everest is in the Himalayas. It is about 8,848 metres (29,029 ft) high.
Its peak is on the border of Nepal and Tibet. It is above the Death Zone where the air is too thin for a human being, so usually extra oxygen is used when climbing. The Death Zone refers to the parts of Mount Everest that are above 25,000 ft above sea level.
Two other mountains also can be named as "highest" mountains - the volcano Mauna Kea on Hawaii island is the highest mountain measured from the base underwater to the summit (more than 11 kilometres), and the summit of Chimborazo is the fixed point on Earth which is the greatest distance from the center - because of the modified ball shape of the planet Earth which is "thicker" around the Equator than measured around the poles.
