Meaning of life
Many religions, ways of thinking, and creative artists have tried to find the Meaning of Life, but have no sensible answer. Some people say that we will never know what the meaning of life is. Many religions claim to offer some answers. There are also ways of thinking called philosophies which claim to answer this large question. There are also artists who paint or create sculptures to attempt to explain it. There are musicians who write music and writers who write stories to try to explain life..
Many have different opinions on what the meaning is. Some say life is a big test and we are the students trying to prepare for the exam. Some think it is all about the relationships that one holds throughout their lives. Some people say that human nature is full of violence, but on the other hand, there are some people who say that life is full of happiness and peace. Still other minds say that the meaning of life is to achieve goals you set throughout your existence. According to Douglas Adams, the answer to the question is 42. The biological answer is to have children, which is to continue the survival of your genes. Others say the meaning of life is simply to enjoy life, and to enjoy every day. Some say, however, the meaning of life is simply to give life a meaning. Others, like Solomon, argue that 'life is useless'. (Ecclesiastes 1:2)
