Hong Kong
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Chinese: 香港, pinyin: "Xiānggǎng", literally "Fragrant Port") is one of two Special Administrative Regions (SARs) of the PRC (the other is Macau). It is one of the richest and most highly developed places in the world. Hong Kong grew quickly in the decades after World War II and now has become a famous world class financial center.
Hong Kong is divided into 3 main parts:
Hong Kong Island
Kowloon
New Territories (including 235 outlying islands)
Hong Kong was a British colony since 1842. In 1997, after the Handover, Hong Kong became a part of China.
