Moresnet
Moresnet or Neutral Moresnet (Esperanto: Neutra Moresneto) was a very small territory that existed from 1816 to 1919. It had a size of 3.5 kmÂ². It existed because its neighbours could not agree on who should own it, so they decided to make it a neutral territory where both neighbours would both have power. It was 7 km Southwest of Aix-la-Chapelle (Germany), and south of the points were the borders of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands come together on the Vaalserberg.
