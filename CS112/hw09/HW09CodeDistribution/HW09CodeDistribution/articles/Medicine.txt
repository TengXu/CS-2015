Medicine
Medicine is the science that deals with diseases (illnesses) in humans and animals, the best ways to prevent diseases, and the best ways to return to a healthy condition.
People who practice medicine are most often called medical doctors or physicians. Often doctors work closely with nurses and many other types of health care professionals.
There are different aspects of medicine that specialist doctors deal with. For example, paediatrics is the study of diseases that affect children.
