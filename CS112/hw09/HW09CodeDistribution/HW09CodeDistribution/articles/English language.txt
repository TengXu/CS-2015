English language
English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in Anglo-Saxon England in the early Middle Ages. It is now the most widely used language in the world.
It is spoken in many countries around the world. It is the first language of the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Republic of Ireland, New Zealand and a number of Caribbean nations. There are about 375 million native speakers (people with first language as English), which makes English the second most spoken language in the world. About 220 million more people speak it as a second language and there are as many as a billion people who are learning it.
English has changed, and has been changed by many different languages. Because nearly 60% of the vocabulary comes from Latin, English is sometimes called the most Latin of the Germanic languages.
