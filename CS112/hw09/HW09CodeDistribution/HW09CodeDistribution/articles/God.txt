God
Abrahamic religions say that there is a supernatural being called God. Hinduism says there is more than one god. Theists believe that God created everything that exists. In most religions, God is believed to be immortal (cannot die), and to have powers to control nature far beyond the powers of humans.
The belief that there is at least one god is usually called theism. People who reject belief that any deities exist are called atheists. Agnostics think we cannot know for sure whether any deities exist, but still might (or might not) believe at least one deity exists. People who believe in a god but not in religion are called deists. People who believe that the definition of "God" should be defined before taking a theological position are ignostic.
In some religions there are many gods. This is called polytheism. In other religions, there is only one, which is called monotheism. In polytheism the word "gods" is usually written in lowercase letters. God is usually written with an uppercase letter when only one god is believed to exist. Some polytheists also use uppercase when talking about their most important god.
