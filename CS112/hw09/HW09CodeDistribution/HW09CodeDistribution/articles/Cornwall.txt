Cornwall
Cornwall (Cornish: Kernow) is a county in the far south west of England in the UK. Truro is the capital of the Unitary Authority that has administered Cornwall since 2009. Truro is also the only city and has the cathedral of the Diocese of Truro. The Duchy of Cornwall is an estate which belongs to the Prince of Wales (who is also the Duke of Cornwall), but only part of it is in Cornwall. Cornwall is split from Devon by the River Tamar.

Some people in Cornwall have revived Cornish, a very old recently extinct Celtic language of the area of Britain which is called Cornwall, which is related to Breton and to Welsh. There is also a dialect of the English language spoken in Cornwall.
Cornwall has a population of approx 550,000 and its population is divided almost equally between native Cornish and incomers from elsewhere in the UK, mostly England. Many Cornish people consider themselves as descendents of the indigenous Britons, and not English, and are recognised by Celtic organisations worldwide as such.
Tintagel Castle is on the north coast of Cornwall. Falmouth harbour is one of the largest natural harbours in the world. Newquay is one of the larger holiday resorts and popular with surfers.
Since early times Cornwall has been an important area for the mining of tin. Tin is no longer mined but china clay is still an important industry. Bodmin Moor is the largest and highest of the granite moors of Cornwall. The climate is generally mild, with much frontal rain. The varied scenery and historical monuments attract many tourists to Cornwall.
The most important transport links between Devon and Cornwall are the Plymouth to Penzance railway line and the A30 and A38 major roads.
The Scilly Isles are a group of islands south west of Cornwall and forming part of the county. The Scilly Isles have a long history of shipwrecks because of the rocky coasts. There are 530 known ship wrecks around the isles.
