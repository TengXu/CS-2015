Gun
A gun is a weapon used to shoot metal pieces called bullets, usually meant to hurt, harm, kill, or scare people and animals. Guns are also called firearms. They are of many different sizes; small enough to hold in one hand, or large enough to fire metal pieces to sink a warship. Guns that are small enough to be carried and used by one person have the same basic parts: a trigger, a barrel, and a handle. The trigger is pulled by a finger to fire the bullet. The barrel guides the bullet. The handle is held by the human who will fire the gun.
In military terms, the word "firearm" is used for the type of weapons that soldiers carry: pistols (known as 'shorts') and rifles ('longs'). The word "gun" is used for larger guns that fire at higher speed. The weapons on warships and tanks are called "guns" or "turrets" (if placed on a rotating base), not "firearms".
Guns are very effective weapons. Guns fire bullets at a very high speed, which is much more deadly than an arrow or spear.
Bullets are basically non-explosive bits of metal, as opposed to shells, which explode upon impact. A modern bullet is the front part of a round or cartridge. A cartridge consists of a bullet, a casing, propellant and a primer. When the rear end is struct by the hammer, an explosion in the back of the cartridge shoots the bullet.
Cartridges have different ways of being loaded into different kinds of weapons. Cartridges can be loaded directly into a firearm or into a clip, a magazine or other bullet container which is loaded into the firearm. Some firearms have their rounds loaded into the stock (or butt) of the weapon. A clip is loaded with rounds and the clip is loaded into a weapon. The magazine is a container for the rounds which has a spring that moves the bullets into place for firing. Firearms known as revolvers have a cylinder with holes that the bullets are loaded into. Modern guns are usually loaded with a magazine and are called automatic loading.
