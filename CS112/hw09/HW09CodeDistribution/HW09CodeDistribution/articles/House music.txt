House music
House music is a type of dance music. It began during the early 1980s from disco and the black American soul music tradition. It takes its name from the Warehouse, a Chicago club where DJs first played their records to a large audience. The original "House" sound is characterized by "four on the floor" beats at 120-130 BPM, forward-driven bass lines, an emphasis on the second and fourth beats of each measure, handclaps, and cymbals. Over the years, house has created many types of house music. These include:
Acid house (with its "trippy" melodic lines, usually generated on a Roland 303 synthesizer)
Deep house (with a greater emphasis on "soul" and atmospheric background sounds)
Speed garage (featuring choppy basslines, reggae-style vocals and often "broken" beats)
Progressive house (usually faster than traditional house, with many volume and phase changes and a "progression" of different background sounds)
Disco house (even greater emphasis on the bassline, and the return of many disco-like additions such as violin sections)
Tech house ("electric" / techno sounds featured over a house-derived beat, with melodic progression often less emphasized)
Latin house (incorporating elements of traditional Latin American music)
Tribal house (greater emphasis on drumlines; melodies may be present, but with less traditional "progression")
