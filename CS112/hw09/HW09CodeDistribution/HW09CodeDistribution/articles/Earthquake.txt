Earthquake
An earthquake (also known as a quake, or tremor) is a violent movement of the rocks in the Earth's crust. Earthquakes are usually quite brief, but may repeat over a long period of time. They are the result of a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust. This creates seismic waves, waves of energy that travel through the Earth.
There are large earthquakes and small earthquakes. Big earthquakes can take down buildings and cause death and injury. The study of earthquakes is called seismology. Seismology studies the frequency, type and size of earthquakes over a period of time.
When the earth moves offshore in the ocean, it can cause a tsunami. This can cause just as much death and destruction as an earthquake. Landslides can happen, too. This is an important part of the Earth's cycle.
Earthquakes are measured using observations from seismometers. The magnitude of an earthquake, and the intensity of shaking, is measured on a numerical scale. On the scale, 3 or less is scarcely noticeable, and magnitude 7 (or more) causes damage over a wide area.
