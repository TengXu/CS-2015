Mecca is the holiest city in the Islamic world. Every year, millions of Muslims take a pilgrimage to Mecca. This is called the Hajj, where they follow in the footsteps of Muhammad. All Muslims who are able to do so are expected to do the Hajj at least once in their life. The Kaaba and Masjid al-Haram, the holiest mosque in Islam is here. Mecca is closed to non-Muslims except some journalists reporting on the Hajj.
