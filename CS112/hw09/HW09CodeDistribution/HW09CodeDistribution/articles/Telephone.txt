Telephone
For the Lady Gaga song, see Telephone (song).

A telephone is an electric tool. Using a telephone, two people who are in different places can talk to each other. Early telephones needed to be connected with wires. Now telephone calls can be sent with radio. This is called wireless or cordless.
