Halley's Comet
Halley's Comet (Comet Halley) is a comet which comes round every 75 or 76 years. When it is near, it can be seen with the naked eye. It will return in 2061.
The comet is named after Edmond Halley (1656â€“1742), an English astronomer, who predicted the comet's return. Halley's Comet was the first comet to be recognized as periodic.
When the comet came close to the Earth in 1986, it was visited by several space-probes. The probe Giotto from the European Space Agency managed the closest approach to the comet.
The number of years that the comet finishes its full cycle can vary depending on the variable of being obstructed by another planet's gravitational pull.
