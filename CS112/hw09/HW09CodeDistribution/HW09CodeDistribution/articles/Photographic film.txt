Photographic film
Photographic film is a sheet of plastic used to record pictures. The plastic has been specially treated, so it is sensitive to light. That way, it is possible to record an invisible image with the plastic when it is exposed to light. Normal film is shipped in small canisters (boxes) that protect it from the light. A normal photographic film can hold up to 40 pictures. Once all pictures have been recorded, the film has to undergo a special chemical treatment. This is called developing a film. Through that treatment, the pictures become visible (you can see them), and the exposed film is no longer sensitive to light. Different kinds of films exist. Some require more light to be exposed than others. There are also special films which can record infrared light.
