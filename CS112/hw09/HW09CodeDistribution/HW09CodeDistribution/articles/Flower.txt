Flower
A flower is a part of a plant. Flowers are also called the bloom or blossom of a plant. The plant grow on a stalk – a thin node – which supports the flower. Flowers have petals. Inside the petals are the parts which produce seeds.
Flowers are the reproductive structure of flowering plants, which are plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called the Angiosperms.
In many plants, a flower is its most colourful part. We say the plant 'flowers', 'is flowering' or 'is in flower' when this colourful part begins to grow bigger and open out. There are many different kinds of flowers in different areas in the world. Even in the coldest places, for example the Arctic, flowers can grow during a few months.
Flowers may grow separately on the plant, or they may grow together in an inflorescence.
