Manchester City Football Club is a English football club. Its coach is the Chilean Manuel Pellegrini.
The club plays in the Premier League and is owned by a royal family from Abu Dhabi. As of September 1, 2008 they are the richest club in the Premier League.
They won the 2011–12 Premier League championship, their first in the top flight since the 1967–68 season.

The stadium is part-owned by Manchester City Council, and could only be built on the understanding that Manchester City would take a tenancy after the 2006 Commonwealth Games, which the club agreed to do.
