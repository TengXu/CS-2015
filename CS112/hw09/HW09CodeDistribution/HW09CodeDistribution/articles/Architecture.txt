Architecture
Architecture is a term that means either the science of the design of structures or buildings such as houses, places of worship, office buildings, or the profession of an architect. A person must study at an institution of higher education to become an architect. Architecture can be about small designs such as a garage or large designs such as a whole city. Architecture often overlaps with civil engineering, and architects and civil engineers often work together.
