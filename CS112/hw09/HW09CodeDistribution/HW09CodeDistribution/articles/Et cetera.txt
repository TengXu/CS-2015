Et cetera
Et cetera means "and the rest" in Latin. It is often used in English to continue a list that is longer than what can be normally written. People most often write "et cetera" as etc.. Very rarely, it is also written "&c" because the ampersand, or the "&", is the same as "et". It is also the symbol for "and". Some people write it as "ect", but that is wrong.
"Jane has a lot of pets. She has cats, dogs, cows, horses, kangaroos, rabbits, etc."
"Robert ordered a large amount of groceries in order to stock for later. He ordered carrots, tomatoes, potatoes, eggs, etc."
