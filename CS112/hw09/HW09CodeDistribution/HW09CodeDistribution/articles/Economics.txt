Economics
Economics is the study of how people make choices to get what they want, when they cannot get everything they want. It has been defined as "the study of scarcity and choice" and is basically about individual choice, decisions people make about what to buy and what not to buy.  The word comes from Ancient Greek, and relates to οἶκος oíkos "house" and νόμος nomos "custom" or "law". The models used in economics today were mostly started in the 19th century. People took ideas from the field of political economy because they wanted to use an empirical approach similar to the one used in the natural sciences.
