North Pole
The North Pole is the point that is farthest north on the planet Earth. It is the point on which axis of Earth turns. It is in the Arctic Ocean and it's cold there because the sun does not shine there for about half a year. The ocean around the pole is always very cold and it is covered by a thick sheet of ice.
There is also a Magnetic North Pole. It is near the above North Pole. A compass points toward the magnetic North Pole.
There is a star, called the North Star or the Pole Star, that always appears in the sky above the North Pole. For hundreds of years sailors were able to tell how far north they were by seeing how high the North Star appeared in the sky.
