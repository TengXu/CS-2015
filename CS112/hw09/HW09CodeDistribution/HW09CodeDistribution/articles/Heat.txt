Heat
Heat is a form of energy. In thermodynamics, heat means energy which is moved between two things when one of them is hotter than the other.
Heat is not the same as temperature. The temperature of an object is a measure of the average speed of the moving particles it is made from and the energy of the particles is called the internal energy. When an object is heated, its internal energy can increase to make the object hotter. The first law of thermodynamics says that the increase in internal energy is equal to the heat added minus the work done on the surroundings.
Thermal energy is the type of energy that a thing has because of its temperature. In thermodynamics, thermal energy is the internal energy present in a system in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium because of its temperature. That is, heat is defined as a spontaneous flow of energy (energy in transit) from one object to another, caused by a difference in temperature between two objects; so objects do not possess heat.
