Ontario
Ontario is a province of Canada. It is in the Eastern half of Canada, between Manitoba and Quebec. Ontario has the most people of any province, with 13,150,000 in 2009. It has the second largest area for a province with 1,076,395 kmÂ². Quebec has a larger area. (Nunavut and Northwest Territories are also larger, but are called territories and not provinces).
Ontario shares a border with the United States and there are several border crossings including the one at Niagara Falls. Along the border are 4 large lakes called Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, Lake Huron, and Lake Superior. They each are partly in Ontario and partly in the United States. Together with Lake Michigan in the United States, they are called the Great Lakes.
Toronto is the capital of Ontario. Ottawa, which is the capital of Canada, is also in Ontario. The government of Ontario sits at Queen's Park in Toronto. The leader of the government is called the Premier. There is also a Lieutenant Governor of Ontario who represents the Queen.
Ontario is very big, so sometimes people break it into two. The two parts are called Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario. Most of the people in Ontario live in the south, and that is where the big cities are. The big cities in Southern Ontario are Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton, London, Windsor, and Sarnia. The cities in the north are smaller. In the far north of Ontario hardly any people live at all, and there are no roads or railways.
