Aquaculture
Aquaculture is the farming of fish, shrimp, and algae. Aquaculture supplies fish, such as catfish, salmon, and trout. Aquaculture was developed a long time ago in China and aquaculture supplies over 20% of all the seafood harvested. However aquaculture is quite a new activity in Canada as it only began in 1879. It is- in simpler terms- the farming of seafood.
