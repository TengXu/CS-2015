Lance Armstrong
Lance Armstrong (born Lance Edward Gunderson on September 18, 1971 in Plano, Texas, USA) is an American bicycle rider. He was accused of using drugs which helped him in competition, and in 2012 the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) stripped him of all his titles from 1998 to 2006. He was also banned forever from cycling competitions in 2012.
Before his titles were taken back, he won the Tour de France seven times in a row, from 1999 to 2005. He did this several years after having brain surgery and testicular surgery, and a long course of chemotherapy in 1996, to treat testicular cancer that spread to his brain and lungs. He used to race for the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team, but was only team leader during the Tour de France.
Armstrong retired from professional cycling in 2011.
