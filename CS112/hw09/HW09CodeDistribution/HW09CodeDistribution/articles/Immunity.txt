Immunity
Immunity is the ability of the body to defend itself from 'foreign bodies'. This means rejecting infections, clearing up dust which gets in the lungs, and killing cancer cells. Vaccination builds on the natural immune system to make a person resist certain diseases.
Immunity is of two types. Innate immunity protects the host against infection, but has no 'memory', and so gives no long-term immunity.
The second type is adaptive immunity, which does have a kind of 'memory'. It does give long-term protection against specific pathogens.
All animals, plants and fungi have some innate immunity. Vertebrates also have adaptive immunity.
People can be immunised from some diseases by having a vaccination (injection of some dead or weakened virus, or bacteria that causes the disease). By doing so, the body learns how the virus/bacteria harms the body, and will react more quickly to fight the virus/bacteria when it comes in contact with the virus/bacteria again. When your body has defended itself against the virus/bacteria it will trap the certain virus/bacteria in a "net" so when the virus/bacteria comes back it will be easier to trap those viruses/bacteria as well.
