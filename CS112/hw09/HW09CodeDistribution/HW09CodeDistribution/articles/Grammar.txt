Grammar
Grammar means the rules about how to speak and write in a language. The Ancient Greeks used to call it grammatikē tékhnē, the craft of letters. It can have any of these meanings:
The study of a language: how it works, and everything about it. This is background research on language.
The study of sentence structure. A set of rules and examples to show how the language should be used. This is a correct usage grammar, as in a textbook or manual.
The system which people learn as they grow up. This is the native-speaker's grammar.p446p453
When we speak, we use the native-person's grammar, or as near as we can. When we write, we try to write with correct grammar. So, speaking and writing a language each have their own style.
