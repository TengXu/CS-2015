Orange
Orange is a color. It is the combination of red and yellow.
Orange is the color of an orange fruit, which is where the name of the color comes from. Before the orange fruit was introduced to England in the 1500s, this color was called red-yellow. The first recorded use of orange as a color name in English was in 1512, in the court of King Henry VIII.
Orange is also one of the few words in the English language that does not rhyme with any other word.
