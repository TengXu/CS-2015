Google
Google is one of the largest search engines on the World Wide Web (WWW). Search engines also do other things than searching. Other search engines (for example, AOL) use its software and information (database) too. That makes it the most-used search engine on the web. Every day, 200 million (200,000,000) people use it. Google's main office ("Googleplex") is in Mountain View, California, USA.
With Google, people can also search for pictures, Usenet newsgroups, news, and things to buy online. By June 2004, Google had 4.28 billion web pages on its database, 880 million (880,000,000) pictures and 845 million (845,000,000) Usenet messages â€” six billion things.
"To google," as an action word (verb) means "to search for something on Google". Because Google is so popular (more than half of people on the web use it) it has been used to mean "to search the web". Google dislikes this use since the name of the company is a trademark.
