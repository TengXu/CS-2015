Mountain
A mountain is a natural rise of the Earth's surface that usually has a "summit" (or "top"). It is usually steeper and taller than a hill. Mountains are often thought of as being a hill of over 600 metres (about 2,000 feet), but this thought is not the same in every country.
Mountains are important to life on Earth, because most rivers begin in mountains and carry water from the mountains down to the sea.
