Gravity
Gravity, or gravitation, is one of the fundamental forces of the universe. In this article, we discuss it in three parts:
Everyday sense: the force which causes objects to fall onto the ground.
Newton's laws: how gravity keeps the Solar System together.
Einstein's theory of general relativity: the role of gravity in the universe.
Some physicists think gravity is caused by gravitons, but they are still unsure.
