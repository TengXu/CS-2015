French language
The French language (French: français, pronounced "frahnseh") is a Romance language that was first spoken in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Quebec and Switzerland. About 220 million people speak French as a native or a second language. It has also been one of the roots of other languages such as the Haitian Creole language. Like most Romance languages, its nouns have genders that are divided into masculine (masculin) and feminine (féminin) words.
