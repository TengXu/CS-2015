Homosexuality
Homosexuality is a sexual orientation. A homosexual person is sexually and romantically attracted to people of their own gender. Men who are attracted to other men are called gay. Women who are attracted to other women can be called gay as well, but are usually called lesbians. People who are attracted to men and women are called bisexual.
Together homosexual, bisexual, and transgender people make up the LGBT community, which stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender. It is difficult to say how many people are homosexual. Homosexuality is known to exist in all cultures and countries and is natural.
