Alkali
In chemistry, an alkali is an aqueous (from water) solution with a pH value of more than seven. The word 'Alkali' comes from the Arabic 'qali' meaning 'from the ashes' since ashes mixed with water were used as cleaning products, and feel soapy.
An alkali is where a base is dissolved in water. Often it is the salt of an Alkali metal
An alkali is the opposite to an acid and can be neutralised (brought down to pH 7) by adding acid.
