Prison
A prison is a building where convicted criminals are held.
Prisons are run by the government. Other words for prison include "penitentiary", "jail" or "gaol" (pronounced like "jail"), and "correctional facility".
A person who has been charged with a crime, but has not yet been convicted for it in a court, may be sent to prison if:
the police have arrested the person and are deciding whether to send them to court,
the court thinks that the person may not come to their trial,
the court thinks that the person may be a danger to the community, or
the court has asked for bail but the person cannot pay the amount.
People held in prisons are called inmates or prisoners. The word convicts may also be used, but only if they have been sentenced to prison because of a crime.
People who have been sentenced to death are also kept in prison until their execution.
In some countries, prisons are also used for political prisoners (people who disagree with the country's leader or government). In times of war, prisoners of war may also be held in prisons.
