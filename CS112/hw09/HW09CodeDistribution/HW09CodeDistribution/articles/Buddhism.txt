Buddhism
Buddhism is a religion founded by Siddhartha Gautama. Buddhism teaches people how to end their suffering by eliminating greed, hatred and ignorance. When people do bad things, they will get bad consequences. Similarly, when people do good things, they will get good consequences. Good and bad things do not cancel out. This cause-and-effect chain is manifested in the endless cycles of life, death and rebirth (reincarnation). The ultimate goal of a Buddhist is to reach the state of enlightenment (Nirvana) and liberate oneself from endless reincarnation and suffering. Some consider Buddhism as a religion, other people think it is a philosophy and for others, Buddhism is a way of finding reality. Some think that it is unnecessary to label it. Gautama Buddha â€” a man who lived between about 563 BC and 483 BC - was a rich prince. He gave up everything to find a way to end suffering. His teachings started in Nepal and slowly spread, after his death, through most of Asia, to Central Asia, Tibet, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, and the East Asian countries of China, Mongolia, Korea, and Japan and have now spread to the west.
