Dissolution of the monasteries
The Dissolution of the monasteries was an event that happened from 1536 to 1540, when English King Henry VIII took away the land and money that the nuns and monks of the Roman Catholic church owned. Henry VIII then gave this land and money to people that supported him.
This was also when Henry VIII made himself the new head of the Church of England (which is a type of Christianity).
It all started when Henry VIII wanted to get a divorce but was refused by the Pope.

He decided to create his own religion - the Church of England.
