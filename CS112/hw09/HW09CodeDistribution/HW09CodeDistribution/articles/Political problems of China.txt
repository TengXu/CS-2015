Political problems of China
The People's Republic of China claims that the island of Taiwan is part of its territory, but the Republic of China (which was the government that controlled all of China from 1911 to 1949) still claims the land as theirs, and tries to control Taiwan.
Many people say the government stops people from having freedom of speech, freedom of religion and other political rights that people in western countries have.
