Provinces and territories of Canada
Canada's land is composed of thirteen parts: ten provinces and three territories. Canada is governed on the principles of a federation: the Provinces' governments share power with the Government of Canada (the federal government). The territories' governments have a more limited set of powers versus the federal government than that of the provinces'.
The provinces are in the south of Canada, and the territories are in the north, where fewer people live.
