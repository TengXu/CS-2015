Flood
Sometimes a river receives a lot of extra water, either from lots of rain or other natural disasters. When this happens, the water overflows from its normal path in the river bed and possibly onto dry land. This is called a flood.
During a flood, people should move themselves and their most precious belongings to higher ground quickly. The process of leaving homes behind in search of a safe place is called evacuation.
