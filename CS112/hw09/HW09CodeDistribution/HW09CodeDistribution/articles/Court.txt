Court
For the court as the seat of a royal person see royal court.
For the court as a space inside a building, see courtyard.
A court, in law, is a part of the government in which people come together as a tribunal to decide how the law works in regards to a case. Some disagreements a court may decide are whether a person is guilty of a crime, who is the legal owner of property, or who the children of two divorced parents should live with. A court is usually in a special building called a courthouse.
Most countries have many courts that deal with different issues (i.e civil court vs criminal court.)
Some courts are higher and can change a decision made by a lower court.This is called court hierarchy. You can start from a simple magistrates court and go up to a supreme state or national court. The higher the court the more experienced a judge will be.
Courts usually set the punishments for a breach in law. The punishments can be fines to imprisonment to (in some countries)the death penalty.
