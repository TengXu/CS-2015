Ireland
Ireland is an island in Europe. To the west of Ireland is the Atlantic Ocean; to the east of Ireland, across the Irish Sea, is the island of Great Britain.
The island of Ireland is about 486 km (302 miles) long and about 288 km (179 miles) wide. About 6.4 million people live on the island â€“ 4.6 million in the Republic of Ireland and 1.8 million in Northern Ireland.
The River Shannon, which runs from north to south, is the longest river on the island. Ireland has many lakes. Lough Neagh, in Northern Ireland, is the largest lake in Ireland. Ireland is known for its beautiful landscapes, music, history, and mythology.
Today, the island of Ireland is split between two countries:
The Republic of Ireland is five sixths (83%) of the island. Its capital city is Dublin. The official languages are Irish and English. Most people in the country can speak a little Irish, but only a small number of the population are fluent or native speakers. Almost everyone learns Irish at school, but most people outside the Gaeltacht speak English in their day-to-day lives.
Northern Ireland is the remaining one sixth (17%) of the island and is part of the United Kingdom. The capital of Northern Ireland is Belfast.
Many people live in the eastern coasts of both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Dublin has a population of more than one million, and the Greater Belfast region has a population of nearly half a million.
