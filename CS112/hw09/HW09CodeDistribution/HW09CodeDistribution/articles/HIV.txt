HIV
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a type of virus called a retrovirus, which infects the human immune system (the system in the body which is in charge of fighting off illness). HIV may cause AIDS (a collection of diseases and symptoms, or problems in the body) by eventually killing the white blood cells, which a healthy body uses to fight off disease.
