King
A king is a man who rules a country, because of inheritance. A king usually comes to power when one of his parents, or relatives, dies. For most of history, most countries were ruled in this way, especially in Europe. In some countries, people chose a new king from other people to decide from.
The wife of a king is called a queen. A woman who becomes a ruler because of inheritance is also called a queen.
If a country has a king or a queen, that means it is a monarchy. A country which a king or queen rules is called a kingdom.
