Matrix (mathematics)
In mathematics, a matrix (plural: matrices) is a rectangular table of cells of numbers, with rows and columns. The rows are each left-to-right (horizontal) lines, and the columns go top-to-bottom (vertical). The top-left cell is at row 1, column 1 (see diagram at right).
There are rules for adding, subtracting and "multiplying" matrices together, but the rules are different than for numbers. As an example,  does not always give the same result as , which is the case for the multiplication of ordinary numbers. A matrix can have more than 2 dimensions, such as a 3D matrix. Also, a matrix can be one-dimensional, as a single row or column.
Many natural sciences use matrices quite a lot. In many universities, courses about matrices (usually called linear algebra) are taught very early, sometimes even in the first year of studies. Matrices are also very common in computer science.
