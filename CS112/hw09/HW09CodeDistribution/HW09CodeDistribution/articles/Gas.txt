Gas
A gas is one of the four most common states of matter. In a gas the molecules move freely and are independent of each other. This makes it different from a liquid where the molecules are loosely attached, or from a solid where the bonds are strong and hold the molecules together. Gases can be pure, where each molecule is made of individual atoms, elemental, where each molecule is made of more than one of the same atom bound together, or compounds where molecules are made of many types of atoms together. An example of a pure gas is Neon, an example of an elemental gas is Hydrogen and an example of a compound gas could be Carbon Dioxide.
A gas mixture contains a mix of any of the above types, for example air which is 78% nitrogen, 20% oxygen and 2% argon and carbon dioxide.
