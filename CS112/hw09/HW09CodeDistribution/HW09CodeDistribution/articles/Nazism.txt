Nazism
Nazism (or National Socialism; German: Nationalsozialismus) is a set of political beliefs associated with the Nazi Party of Germany. It started in the 1920s. The Party gained power in 1933, starting the Third Reich. They lasted in Germany until 1945, at the end of World War II.
Nazism is considered far-right politics. It is a form of fascism and uses biological racism and antisemitism. Much of the philosophy of this movement was based on an idea that the Aryan race was better than all others and had the greatest ability to survive. According to the racist ideas of Nazism, the Germanic peoples were the Herrenvolk (master race), whilst the inferior races who were said to be the Jews, Gypsies and blacks were classified as Untermenschen (sub-humans).
To implement the racist ideas, in 1935 the Nuremberg Race Laws banned non-Aryans and political opponents of the Nazis from the civil-service and forbid any sexual contact with people defined as Aryan and non-Aryan. The Nazis sent millions of Jews, Roma and other people to concentration camps where they were killed. These killings are now called the Holocaust.
The word Nazi is a short for Nationalsozialist (supporter of the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei) in the German language. This means "National Socialist German Workers' Party".
