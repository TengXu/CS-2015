Phases of the Moon
The phases of the moon are the different ways the Moon looks from Earth during a month. Each lunar phase can be identified by the appearance of the moon and the time of the month. As the Moon moves in space, different parts of it face the Sun. This means that different parts of it are lit up. We only see one side of the moon from Earth because it rotates so that one side is always facing us. The moon phase takes about 29.5 days. The phases of the moon appears to be a circular disk, which is illuminated to some degree by direct sunlight.
