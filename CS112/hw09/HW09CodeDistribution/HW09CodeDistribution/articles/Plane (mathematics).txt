Plane (mathematics)
Plane can also refer to airplane.

A plane is a perfectly flat surface extending in all directions. Try to imagine the ceiling of a room, only extended into all directions infinitely. A plane has two dimensions : length and width. All planes are flat surfaces. If a surface is not flat, it is called a curved surface.
The tool plane can be used to create a flat, level surface like the mathematical plane: therefore the name.
In geometry, a plane is made up of an infinite number of lines (or points). It has no depth.
A plane figure is part of a plane. It is named by the capital letters (e.g. A, B, C, ...X, Y, Z) that are put at its corners.
Mathematicians say two planes can be:
Parallel = they never meet.
Concurrent = they meet forming a line.
Coincident = they are one and the same.
