Ferdinand Magellan
Ferdinand Magellan (1480 â€“ April 27, 1521) was a Portuguese explorer. He became the first European to sail the Pacific Ocean, and the first to sail around the world. Magellan's voyage proved that the Earth was round and also known for having organised the expedition that resulted in the first circumnavigation of the earth.
He was born in Oporto, Portugal in 1480. He worked in a royal court where he learned many important skills, including map making, navigation and astronomy. In 1505 he joined the navy. When he worked for Portugal, he went to many parts of the world, such as India, the Spice Islands, East Africa, and Morocco. After he lost his job for the King of Portugal, he went to work for the King of Spain.
He was also the first to sail through the Strait of Magellan, so it was named for him. Magellan himself was killed in the Philippines, on April 27, 1521 in Mactan because he had traded with them with iron and fruits and thought, somehow, they were stealing.
