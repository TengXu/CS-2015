The most interesting thing I found in this article was the  artificial intelligent machine "Watson", which is really good at answering questions.
I think Watson¡¯s capabilities can contribute to the education system, to help both teachers and students. 
I think the differences between Watson-style and human-style thinking is that Watson-style thinking has some specific limits. But human-style thinking is really limitless and free.
