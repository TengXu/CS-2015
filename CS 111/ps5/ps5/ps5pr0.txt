Personally speaking, Kurzweil's idesa of technology is kind of crazy to me but it does have some meaningful points. Humans keep seeking for eternal health, and technology is helping people get healthier. His prediction is too extreme, im my opinion, human body is totally different from a machine. Technology can make our life better, only if we know how to use it wisely.
