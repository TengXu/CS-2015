I do not agree with that, whether in science or business, we ¡°don¡¯t have to settle for models at all¡±, which is too extreme and absolute. Admittedly, there are sometimes when we don't know how to run some experiments that would falsify the hypotheses ¡ª the energies are too high, the accelerators too expensive, and so on. But with the increasingly developing science and technology, scientists will be able to prove those hypotheses one day, whether they are right or wrong. Dealing with huge amounts of data, we cannot just entirely rely on computers.
