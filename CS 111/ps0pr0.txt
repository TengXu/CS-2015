Sometimes I feel really confused when I heard my parents talking about some places that were in the north or in the west of the city, because I have no idea which direction is north or west. They always tried to teach me the "geographic directions", but I just cannot be used to it. Admittedly, geographic directions have advantages especially when you are talking with someone who is in different directions.
It can be really difficult to tell someone how to get to somewhere in the phone without geographic directions.
